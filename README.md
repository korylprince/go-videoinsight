# About

`go-videoinsight` is a minimal client for the [VideoInsight](https://i-pro.com/us/en/surveillance/products/video-management-software/) API documented [here](http://downloadvi.com/downloads/Beta/API/Documentation/InsightAPI%20v.1.0.20120.pdf). This library only supports the API calls I need, but hopefully can be used as a starting place for others that need it.
